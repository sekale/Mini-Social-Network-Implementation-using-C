# MiniSocialNetwork
This was a class project that involved connecting users in a network based on attributes such as university year, likings, interests, and calculated a distance number. If the number spanned a range then he/she was considered a friend and the two friends represented by nodes in a graph were connected.

## DIJSKTRA'S ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION

The users that were connected as second friends or third friends were traversed using dijkstra's algorithm. So, for example if a query were made to find if User A were connected to User B then a BFS would allow us to find the shortest path and the route would be returned by the algorithm.
